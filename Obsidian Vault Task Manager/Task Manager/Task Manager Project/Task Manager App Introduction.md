Task Manager is an application that allows users to register, add, and manage many tasks. In addition to adding new tasks, users can also maintain them in progress, cancel, and completed the screen. In addition, you can change the task's status, remove it, update your profile, and, in the event that you forget your password, retrieve it by sending an email.
